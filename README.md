SUSY-QM (supersymmetric quantum mechanics)
==========================================

Numerical calculation of energy eigenvalues and wavefunction eigenvectors for various one-dimensional model potentials of molecules using ideas from supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY-QM). The model potentials considered are: (1) hindered rotor (2) anharmonic oscillator and (3) V(x) = x^6-3x^2. For the third model, the code written is a novel implementation using an overdetermined coherent states basis together with a technique from SUSY-QM to compute some excited state wavefunctions and their associated energies.
